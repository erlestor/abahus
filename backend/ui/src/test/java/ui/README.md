#Test for Housing Application 

#what is tested 

AppTest.java tests the Dashboardcontroller to make sure they work correctly. 

testHandleLogIn tests that the handleLogIn method works as it is supposed with correct inputs in the textfields. It also tests that there are error message labels that pop up if the input is wrong. 

testHandleCreateUser test that the handleCreateUSer method works as it is supposed with correct inputs in the textfields. It also tests that there are error message labels that pop up if the input is wrong. 

In the next deliverable we will test mainController as well, but since that was not ready for this deliverable, we chose to test the dashboardController and wait for the extended functions on the mainController.
