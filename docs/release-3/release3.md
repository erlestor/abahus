# Group gr2129 repository

## What's new?

Our app is still an house renting app. In this release the app is now a website that uses a restapi to connect to our java backend from release2. See gr2129/readme.md in tag "Deliverable 3" to see in depth information about the new architecture.

## User stories

Since our frontend framework was changed most of our issues have been technical. This is the only change in user functionality. To see those issues check issues marked with deliverable 3 on gitlab.

### Change availability of house (us-5)

A owner of a house wishes to change the availability of the house after being contacted by a person wanting to rent. The house should then be shown as unavailable to the owner and not show up for other users.
