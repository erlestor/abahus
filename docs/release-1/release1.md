## Description of the app

We intend to write a AirBnB-inspired house renting app.
The dashboard of the app will display housing that is available for rent.
The user can register, and thereafter post houses that will be available at the dashboard.
Registered users can send email requests for rent.
Booking requests will be available to the landlord.

# User stories

## Register (us-1)

As a private person I wish to register a user.

The user needs to be able to enter email and password into a form such that this is saved
and the user can login later. The user then wants to be automatically logged in and sent
to the main dashboard.

## Login (us-1)

A user wishes to login to a previously created account using email and password.
The user then wants to be sent to the main dashboard.
