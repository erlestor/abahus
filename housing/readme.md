## Description of the app

We intend to write a AirBnB-inspired house renting app.
The dashboard of the app will display housing that is available for rent.
The user can register, and thereafter post houses that will be available at the dashboard.
Registered users can send email requests for rent.
Booking requests will be available to the landlord.

### Note about JSON module

For some reason, Paths returns different paths when using `mvn test` and `mvn javafx:run`. `housing/core/src/main/java/core/Json.java#21-22` may need to be changed if experiencing issues with tests or running project.
