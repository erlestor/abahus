# Group project GR21 29

We are making an application for renting houses.

The project uses maven.

Our code is inside of "housing", and is divided with a three layer arcitecture, with maps for Json, Main and UI. More information about the aplication is in the readme-file inside of housing. The test-folders contain all the information about the test. See the ui-testing branch for information about the ui-tests and the tests as far as we have them.

You are able to create a user from the dashboard and then log into that user later on. With that user you can post and delete houses for rent, and se other users houses.
