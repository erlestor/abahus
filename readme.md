# Group project GR21 29

We are making an application for renting houses.

The project uses maven.

Our code is inside of "housing", and inside of "main" we have made 3 java-files for the domaine logic, as well as a java-file for persistense with Json. There are Json files for storage in det data-folder. We have also made tests for the domaine logic. For the user interface we have made two controllers, one app-file and two FXML-files. You are able to create a user from the dashboard and then log into that user later on.

## How to run

Run these commands inside "housing":

- mvn install
- cd ui
- mvn javafx:run
