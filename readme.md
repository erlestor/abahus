# Group project GR21 29

We are making an application for renting houses. 

Our code is inside of "housing", and inside of "core" we have made 3 java-files for the domaine logic, as well as a java-file for persistense with Json. We have also made tests for the domaine logic. For the user interface we have made two controllers, one app-file and two FXML-files. You are able to create a user from the dashboard and then log into that user later on.
